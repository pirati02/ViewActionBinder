# ViewActionBinder

idea from butterknife but this isnot working with Java CodeGeneration

view actions
> OnClick, OnTextChange, OnSeekChange, OnItemClick, OnCheckChange, OnItemSelect, OnLongClick, OnTouch

view model with activity field!

view actions can be injected into view model, see example https://github.com/pirati02/ViewActionBinder/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/dev/baqari/inject/MainViewModel.java
